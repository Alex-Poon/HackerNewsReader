Hacker News Reader

I'm creating this app as a learning exercise for me, and to 'scratch my own itch' so to speak - to have a nice simple way to read HN from my iphone while pushing my daughter on the swing. I also intend open-sourcing this so that people can have a look at a nontrivial demo app. The more people that know obj-c/UIKit, the merrier!

See the code:

Open in app store:

Purposes:
* Practice
* Open source so others can benefit
* Not really aiming to make a bit of money, but if it made some pocket money it'd be nice
