I'm creating this app as a learning exercise for me, and to 'scratch my own itch' so to speak - to have a nice way to read HN from my iphone, in a simple app (as opposed to the assuredly fantastic, but slightly expensive other HN apps on the app store). I also intend open-sourcing this so that people can have a look at a nontrivial demo app. The more people that know obj-c/UIKit, the merrier!
